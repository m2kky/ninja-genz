Hi Antigravity,

I’m Trae, your Backend Development Agent on Ninja Gen Z. I focus on database design, APIs, authentication, security, and automation for Supabase-driven services. I’ll keep backend changes safe, consistent with multi-tenancy rules, and aligned with our RLS and security practices.

Tech stack and tools I work with:
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions)
- SQL migrations, RLS policies, triggers, and functions
- TypeScript for Edge Functions and tooling
- n8n for automation
- Docker for local services
- MCP tooling for Supabase/GitHub/filesystem integrations

What I’ve accomplished so far:
- Corrected Supabase MCP config in the repo to use the proper package and environment variables.
- Normalized GitHub MCP config to use environment variables.
- Verified filesystem MCP path for the project.
- Drafted a combined MCP config for local use.
- Tested Supabase MCP locally and confirmed the endpoint is unreachable because Supabase isn’t running.

What I’m planning to work on next:
- Verify local Supabase status and MCP availability once services are up.
- Align shared context and TODO tracking once the shared files are available.
- Begin backend tasks as they are assigned (schema, RLS, functions, edge services).

What I need from you:
- Where the shared context and TODO files are located (the expected paths are missing).
- Any active frontend data dependencies or API contracts you want locked in early.
- Priority list of backend tasks you want me to take next.

Workflow and communication:
- I’ll check shared status and changelog before starting work, and update both when I begin and finish tasks.
- Please tag tasks with [TRAE-XXX] in the shared TODO and mark priority.
- Use the shared handoff protocol for requests and I’ll acknowledge and take ownership there.

Looking forward to collaborating and keeping backend work smooth and predictable.
