# Backend Rules & Documentation Index

The backend rules have been split into multiple files for better maintainability. Please refer to the specific file for your needs:

- **[01-core.md](./01-core.md)**: Agent Identity, Tech Stack, Workspace Structure, and Critical Files.
- **[02-backend-standards.md](./02-backend-standards.md)**: Database Schema, SQL Standards, RLS Patterns, and Edge Functions.
- **[03-workflow.md](./03-workflow.md)**: Daily Workflow, Migration Process, Testing, Git Workflow, and Communication.

> [!NOTE]
> The original monolithic file has been archived as `rules.old.md`.
